## My process

1. Began with a mobile-first approach.
2. I then used HTML to structure the elements for the accordion.
3. Next, was using CSS to style and beautify, and control the responsiveness of the page.
4. Lastly, I used vanilla JS to control the **"plus"** and **"minus"** images.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt of the **<details></details>** and **<summary></summary>** tags. They have in-built functionality of controlling the appearance and disappearance of the questions in the FAQ accordion.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

<details>
  <summary>
    What is Frontend Mentor, and how will it help me?
    <span class="plus-img">
      <img src="./assets/images/icon-plus.svg" alt="plus-img" />
    </span>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Frontend Mentor offers realistic coding challenges to help developers
    improve their frontend coding skills with projects in HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript. It's suitable for all levels and ideal for portfolio building.
